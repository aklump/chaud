# chaudio

A configurable, command-line tool to easily switch between different audio configurations. This is different from other solutions because you create names (and aliases) that represent input/output configurations.

## Install

Assuming `~/bin` is in your `$PATH` variable, create a symlink to wherever you've installed this app.

```shell
cd ~/bin
ln -s /Users/aklump/Code/Packages/mac/chaudio/app/chaudio .
```

This will allow you to call `chaudio <LABEL>` from anywhere

## Configure

* `chaudio -c` to print the configuration filepath.
* Open and modify the configuration.
* A single option may be defined as:
    * input & output
    * input only
    * output only

```
{{ example_config|raw }}
```

## Usage

This shows using the label and alias argument.

```
$ chaudio phone
Phone is active (ðŸŽ¤ External Microphone ðŸ”ˆ External Headphones)
$ chaudio p
Phone is active (ðŸŽ¤ External Microphone ðŸ”ˆ External Headphones)
```

### Without an Argument

This will switch to the next option. When you have only two options this works as a toggle.

```shell
$ chaudio
Phone is active (ðŸŽ¤ External Microphone ðŸ”ˆ External Headphones)
$ chaudio
Speakerphone is active (ðŸŽ¤ USB audio CODEC ðŸ”ˆ MacBook Pro Speakers)
$
```

## Troubleshooting

* Sometimes you might need to *refresh the device* list by running `chaud -c`, which is the command for showing the configuration file. This command reloads system audio information as well.
