# chaudio

A configurable, command-line tool to easily switch between different audio configurations. This is different from other solutions because you create names (and aliases) that represent input/output configurations.

## Requirements

* BASH
* PHP
* Yarn or NPM



## Install
* `composer create-project :@dev --repository="{\"type\":\"github\",\"url\": \"https://github.com/aklump/chaudio\"}"`
* Assuming `~/bin` is in your `$PATH` variable, create a symlink to wherever you've installed this app.
  ```shell
  cd ~/bin
  ln -s /Users/aklump/Code/Packages/mac/chaudio/app/chaudio .
  ```

This will allow you to call `chaudio <LABEL>` from anywhere

## Configure

* `chaudio -c` to print the configuration filepath.
* Open and modify the configuration.
* A single option may be defined as:
    * input & output
    * input only
    * output only

```
{
    "options": [
        {
            "label": "Phone",
            "aliases": [
                "p"
            ],
            "input": {
                "deviceId": "External Microphone",
                "level": 50
            },
            "output": {
                "deviceId": "External Headphones",
                "level": 50
            }
        },
        {
            "label": "Speakerphone",
            "aliases": [
                "sp"
            ],
            "input": {
                "deviceId": "MacBook Pro Microphone",
                "level": 50
            },
            "output": {
                "deviceId": "MacBook Pro Speakers",
                "level": 50
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Usage

This shows using the label and alias argument.

```
$ chaudio phone
Phone is active (ðŸŽ¤ External Microphone ðŸ”ˆ External Headphones)
$ chaudio p
Phone is active (ðŸŽ¤ External Microphone ðŸ”ˆ External Headphones)
```

## Troubleshooting

* Sometimes you might need to *refresh the device* list by running `chaud -c`, which is the command for showing the configuration file. This command reloads system audio information as well.
